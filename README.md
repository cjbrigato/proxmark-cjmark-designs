Here are some designs and mods of the ProxmarkIII which were made for the wild

## My Favorite

My favorite design so far is made of :
- An ElecHouse RDC V2 PM.III Kit
- A very thin Allwinner H3 Board
- A very thin near unseenable 3800mAH battery
- An homemade WebApp running passenger/ruby
- An homemade BSP for the H3 for booting up under < 1sec (Actually 827ms is required to boot from U-Boot SPL to a full start including Webapp)
- An homemade ProxmarkIII client and ARMSRC fork, _deeply_ based on the ICEMAN1001 fork (my Man Of The Year, if you may ask)
- Any Wifi/GSM client with a correct browser (here I use a Galaxy S6 in order to show the scale of the product)

Finish product is of the size of a Galaxy S6, uses ~70mAH when idleing and cas be used in the wild for hours, hidden under near anything as storage or even directly on the arm using armlet/armband like one for Smartphone and such).
